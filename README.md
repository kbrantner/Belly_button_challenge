# Belly_button_challenge



Description
In this challenge assignment I took belly button starter data to create the following:
	A dropdown to see the belly button bacterial data for a specific subject.
	The demographic information for that individual.
	The top ten types of bacteria in their belly button. 
  A bubble map, which shows all of the bacteria found in that individual’s belly button. 


Visuals and Usage:
As the “Test Subject ID No.” changes the information on the demographic information and graphs should change as seen below:

Installation
This code was build using html, JavaScript, and Plotly graphs. It is very useful to have a use the Live Server to open the html in order to view the results of the code as it is being built.  


Support

It was assisted by David Chao, a tutor, who helped me understand how to code the dropdown menu and how to connect the dropdown to the demographics info view and two charts.
